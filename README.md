# ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis with Python

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, which was introduced to the general public on 30 November 2022. It is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which allows it to generate human-like responses to a variety of natural language prompts.

ChatGPT has been adopted across various industries and integrated into popular consumer applications. As the technology behind ChatGPT continues to improve, it is expected to become an even more integral part of our daily lives, transforming how we communicate and interact with the world around us.

However, the model has its controversies. Because the model was trained on a corpus that dates until September 2021, it has limited knowledge of events beyond that date. There also are concerns that the language model can output factual inaccuracies (called "hallucinations"), misinformation and statements that could be construed as libel. 

In this sentiment analysis project, the goal is to understand the attitudes and opinions towards ChatGPT. By analysing tweets published during the first month since its launch, I aim to gain insights into how early adopters used the model, their opinions and common ChatGPT user experience challenges.
